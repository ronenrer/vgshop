<p><strong>A Lightweight Wordpress Development Theme</strong></p>

<p>Bones is designed to make the life of developers easier. It&#8217;s built
using HTML5 &amp; has a strong semantic foundation. It was updated recently
using some of the HTML5 Boilerplate&#8217;s recommended markup and setup.
It&#8217;s constantly growing so be sure to check back often if you are a
frequent user. I&#8217;m always open to contribution. :)</p>

<p>Designed by <strong>Eddie Machado</strong>: http://themble.com/bones</p>
